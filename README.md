# School Management System API

## Project Overview
The School Management System API is a RESTful service built using Node.js and Express, designed to facilitate various operations related to school management. It connects to a MySQL database and provides endpoints to manage data related to students, teachers, classes, and more. The API promotes efficient data management and allows for easy expansion and integration with a frontend application.

## Installation
To set up the School Management System API on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-api.git
   cd school-management-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure it with your database and application settings.
   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=school_management
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000   # Change to your frontend URL if needed
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools such as Postman or curl. The base URL for the API is:
```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Example API calls
- **GET** `/api/students` - Retrieve a list of students.
- **POST** `/api/students` - Add a new student.
- **PUT** `/api/students/:id` - Update an existing student's information.
- **DELETE** `/api/students/:id` - Remove a student from the system.

## Features
- RESTful API architecture for easy integration with frontend applications.
- Enhanced CORS configuration to handle cross-origin requests.
- Error handling middleware for improved error reporting.
- Connection pooling for efficient database handling using MySQL.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are used in this project:
- `express`: A web framework for Node.js.
- `mysql2`: A MySQL client for Node.js, supporting promises.
- `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- `dotenv`: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

You can find these in the `package.json` file.
